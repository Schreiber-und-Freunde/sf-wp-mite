mite. API Integration for Wordpress

**Notice:** This is no complete API implementation. Only the features we need for www.schreiber-freunde.de are implemented. If you miss a feature feel free to implement it and send a pull request or file a feature request in the issues section.

## Usage
Use the wrapper function mite_get_time_entries_by_year() to get the cummulated timeentries per year as json object.

**Be careful and cache the results. This plugin won't do this for you!**
